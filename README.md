# Team-Profile-Generator

## Introduction

Webpage deployed at:  https://bh00fie.github.io/weatherDashboard/

In this Challenge, I'll create an application that generates HTML files using input from a command-line interface.

My task is to take the given starter code and convert it into a working Node.js command-line application. This application will take in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generate an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. 

## Description

The app should:
- Create an HTML file using all the input information of the user in the terminal. 
- Have a appropriate and professional styling
- Allow the use to select which type of employee to show and allow the user to response questions in the terminal to help gather more information about the employee

JS file has been commented on to help understand written code if interested in looking into it more in-depth.
The code has been deployed on the following webpage:  https://bh00fie.github.io/weatherDashboard/

## Final Results
When you open your code in the browser the Team Profile Generator should look similar to the following:
